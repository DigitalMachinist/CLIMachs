# CLIMachs Command Framework 
[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

A complete CLI command framework for the Roll20.net scripting API.

You're looking at code documentation for the objects and functions that make up CLIMachs' guts. This may only be useful to very advanced users and coders with the goal of hacking CLIMachs in some way.

The [CLIMachs reference manual]() describes the how to use the built-in commands and how to create your own commands. It is more suitable for less advanced users and just for typical day-to-day use of CLIMachs.
